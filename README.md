# Convex Hull Shortcut for Blender
Once you install it (by going to Edit > Preferences > Add-Ons > Install > Select this file) and enable it, simply select your vertices/edges/faces in Edit Mode and press RIGHT SHIFT. Normally you can go in Edit Mode to "Mesh > Convex Hull", but since I'm working on some stuff where I need to use this function a lot, I've decided to make this thing haha.
